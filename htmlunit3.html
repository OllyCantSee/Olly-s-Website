                            <h5>What is<span> Whistleblowing?</span></h5> 
                            <p>Whistleblowing is the act of reporting or informing an organisation that a company has been engaging in unlawful or immoral activity. </p>
                            <h5>Is<span> whistleblowing</span> a good thing?</h5>
                            <p>Whistleblowing is considered a good thing! Whistleblowing is a key thing to have within a company as it supports a culture in which employees feel comfortable sharing thier concerns. This keeps moral high in a company as employees dont feel constrained.</p>
                            <h5>What counts as <span>whistleblowing?</span></h5>
                            <p>Things that count as whistleblowing include: a criminal offence (for example fraud), someone's health and safety is in danger, risk or actual damage to the environment, a miscarriage of justice, a company is breaking the law (does not have the right insurance), someone is covering up wrongdoing. When reporting any of these these listed, you are <strong>protected by law!</strong></p>
                            <h5>What DOESN'T count as <span>whistleblowing?</span></h5>
                            <p>It is VERY important that people understand what DOESN'T count as whistleblowing. The most common mislabled whistleblowing is Personal grievances, this includes: Bullying, harassment or discrimination, these are still reportable but it is not covered by whistleblowing law, UNLESS your particular case is in the public interest. </p>
                            <h5>What are the legal ramifications of <span>whistleblowing?</span></h5>
